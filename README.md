This Intelligence Terminal is a high-performance web application designed to visualize and analyze healthcare data breaches across the United States. By utilizing a logarithmic bubble chart, the app provides an immediate visual sense of breach severity, where the size and horizontal placement of each node represent the total number of individuals affected. Beyond simple data mapping, the terminal features an AI Diagnostic Engine that performs a real-time "Threat Profile" on selected incidents—distinguishing between external hacking and internal unauthorized access—while offering localized geographic assessments and specific "Shield Protocols" to help users protect their digital identity. It serves as a powerful research tool for monitoring regional network vulnerabilities and promoting public cybersecurity awareness.
